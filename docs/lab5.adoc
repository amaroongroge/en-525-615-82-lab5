= EN.525.615 - Lab 5 Assignment

WARNING:  This is the first revision of this lab. There may be _some_ bugs. Ask questions as needed in the `Lab 5 Discussion` area on _Teams_.  Read the entire Lab through carefully several times before tackling this assignment.  You should put a _plan_ together *before* you start.

== Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment link

The GitHub Classroom Assignment for this Lab can be found here: https://classroom.github.com/a/FWFS4_Yq

== Overview

You will take the calculator design from Laboratory 4 and interface the ILI9341 LCD screen to the board, using it for the calculator display, rather than the UART debugger.

NOTE:  While you won't have to start from scratch for interfacing with this device, it will require a good deal of work to figure out how to get the hardware connected to the STM32 board and how to get the available libraries to work with the display.  Do not wait until the last minute to tackle this project.  Get a head start because you may find certain parts challenging.

=== Requirements

Your calculator must do everything it did for Laboratory 4 (with the 4x4 matrix keypad as the input).  The output must now go to the LCD display.  Design your output to make the best use the screen.  If you have time, be creative.  But, first and foremost, get the calculator working with the display.

The LCD looks like:

== Hardware Setup

=== Parts list

* Everything from Lab 4
* LCD

=== Hardware Assembly and Setup

You should still have your Lab 4 setup assembled. All of the hardware used in this lab will be in addition to the hardware you set up last time.

==== 3.2" LCD with ILI9341 Driver

LCD's are typically tricky to drive, but with the provided breakout board much of the complexity is taken care of already. This device presents a standard SPI interface that is straightforward to control from a microcontroller.

Hardware wise there are a few things that *must* be hooked up:

1. Power and Ground
* Make sure to use 3.3 Volts from the microcontroller
2. SPI Interface including pins MOSI, MISO, Chip Select, Clock
* It is up to you to locate appropriate pins for this interface since you must find the correct pins that can be configured to the SPI alternate function, this may mean moving some pins around from lab 3
3. Control Lines including Data/Control and Reset
* These pins are used to tell the LCD whether you are sending display data or command, and for resetting the LCD respectively and are both standard GPIO
4. Lite
* This sets the brightness of the screen, use a PWM capable pin to drive this

The function of these pins will be explored more in the lab setup section.  There should already be pins soldered to the LCD board for the pins you must use.

Pins that can be *ignored*:

1. IM3,IM2,IM1,IM0
* These set the mode of the LCD and have been preconfigured for you through the use of solder bridges
2. 3.3V Out
* This is an output from an on board voltage regulator and is not needed
3. Card Detect, and Card CS
* This is for the on board SD card which we are not using

You are welcome to use any of the references, libraries, code snippets in the references.  However, you *must* cite these sources in your laboratory report.  Use without reference is plagiarism, even if you are only using a little bit of the code.  You will receive full credit if you decide to use any or all of these libraries, just cite them properly in your report.  Without citation, you will not earn credit for this lab.

You *must* have photos of your hardware setup and results from your calculator in your lab report.  Failure to do so will be equivalent to not completing the lab.

You *must* include a schematic and/or block diagram showing your calculator design (including the 4x4 matrix keypad and the LCD) and how you connected them to the STM32 board.

Pleas for help on the night the Lab is due will go ignored.  Questions should be formulated well before the due date.  You will get more than two weeks to complete this.  Do not, do not, *_do not_* wait until the last minute to do this lab.  I will point to these very sentences in the Lab Assignment and show very little sympathy.  If you know you are going to be unavailable to complete the lab (for work travel, for example), reach out to me before Nov 10, 2021 so we can make arrangements for you to complete this lab in a timely fashion.  You will not be using the touchscreen in this lab.
